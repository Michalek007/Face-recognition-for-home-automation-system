# Face-recognition-for-home-automation-system
Engineering Thesis (Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics)

The goal of the thesis was to create a home automation system with the capability to recognize usersâ€™ faces. System implementation involved creating a prototype of an electronic device along with its software, as well as implementing facial recognition algorithms and additional software for managing system users. Its implementation was based on embedded devices. Together with developed web service, this forms a fully functional facial recognition system.
